# Description:
#   Repository-wide definitions for the seller/register bazel build system.
#
#   WORKSPACE defines the root of a bazel environment, and contains infrastructural rules that
#   further define the workspace environment.  Any "repositories" need to be defined here, so here
#   we import all the other bazel projects we consume (mostly skylark libraries or custom bazel
#   rules), the core statements that do the fetching of maven artifacts when required, etc.
#
#   Rules invoked from the WORKSPACE will only ever be run during the configuration of this bazel
#   workspace, and this configuration is cached until invalidated (e.g. bumping a version number,
#   or adding a dep, or changing the set of bazel rules we consume).  This is the only place where
#   bazel permits dynamism based on environment, as it locks down the sandboxes in which each
#   build tool executes during the normal build phase.
#
#   Specific configuration values have been extracted to make this file a bit more terese, primarily
#   versions.bzl which contains globals and environment-wide version numbers shared by everyone,
#   and third_party/maven_artifacts.bzl which define any maven artifacts and thier versions that
#   will be available to bazel targets (see third_party/MAVEN.md for more details).
#
#   Custom rule definitions not imported externally are defined in //third_party/tools/build_defs,
#   and other useful bazel tooling will be found in //tools subpackages.

# Load global values (mostly version numbers) used in the WORKSPACE.
# load(
#     "//:workspace_versions.bzl",
#     "RULES_APPLE_VERSION",
